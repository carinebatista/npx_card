## It's me Carine!  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

This is my NPX card to connect with me directly via console or terminal

## Usage

Just hit, and get know me in your terminal ðŸ‘‡ 

```sh
npx carine
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
